# power-formula-calculator
A simple Python-based calculator for determining electrical power using current, voltage, and resistance.

# Electrical Power Calculator

This is a simple Python program to calculate electrical power based on user input. The program provides three methods to calculate electrical power:

1. Using current and voltage: `P = V * I`
2. Using current and resistance: `P = I^2 * R`
3. Using voltage and resistance: `P = V^2 / R`

## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x should be installed on your machine.

### Running the Program
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/electrical-power-calculator.git
   cd electrical-power-calculator
